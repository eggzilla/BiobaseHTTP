EntrezHTTP provides functions to query the NCBI entrez REST interface.

There are multiple different databases and tools, so called eutils,
provided by the service.

For more information on Entrez refer to: [Entrez](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/).
 
Information on the webservice can be found at: [NCBI books](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/).
 
If you plan to include the library in a tool, register it as explained [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/#chapter2.Usage_Guidelines_and_Requiremen).
